# Root Beer Tapper Remake

Welcome to the **Root Beer Tapper Remake**! This is a Python-based remake of the classic arcade game where you play as a bartender serving drinks to a growing crowd of thirsty customers. The game is developed using Pygame and is a fun way to practice Python programming and game development skills.

## Game Overview

In this game, you must serve root beer to impatient customers who approach the bar from the opposite end. The customers spawn randomly in one of the lanes and will start moving towards you after a short delay. Your job is to fill mugs to the required level and send them down the lane to satisfy the customers. But be careful! If a customer reaches the bar without receiving a drink, you'll lose a life. The game ends when you run out of lives.

### Features

- **Random Customer Spawning**: Customers spawn randomly in one of the lanes.
- **Movement Delay**: Customers start moving towards the bartender 3 seconds after spawning.
- **Single Customer per Lane**: Only one customer can occupy a lane at a time.
- **Simple, Engaging Gameplay**: Serve as many customers as possible to score points.
